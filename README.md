# MicroFreqTool
This toolbox was developped to 

(1) investigate the microstructure-induced frequency shift in white matter with crossing fibers using hollow cylinder fiber model (HCFM)

(2) separate the microstructure-related frequency shift from the bulk susceptibility-induced frequency shift by model fitting the gradient-echo frequency evolution
